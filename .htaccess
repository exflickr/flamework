# Hey! Everything in here is better suited to httpd.conf, since
# we get a performance boost if we can turn off AllowOverride and
# not have to stat the webroot for every request. On the other
# hand, this measn we never have to touch apache once it's up.
# Flexibility over performance.
#
# In an ideal world, you'd stick it in here on dev and your build
# system would bundle the changes into (a file incldued in) httpd.conf
# for your production deployment. Yeah. Do that.
