Flamework
=========

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/exflickr/flamework.png)](http://travis-ci.org/exflickr/flamework)

Flamework is a PHP web-application framework, born out of the processes
and house-style developed at Flickr.com.

<b>This library is a work in progress</b>. It is immediately usable,
but lacks many of the components needed to create a fully featured modern 
application. These pieces are being added as the individual contributors
find a need to in their personal projects. If you've written a missing
piece of the puzzle, please send a pull-request.


## Installation - As a base for a new project

* Copy everything in <code>www</code> to a web server running Apache with <code>mod_php</code> and <code>php5-mcrypt</code>.
* Enable <code>AllowOverrides all</code> for the root.
* Copy <code>include/config.php.example</code> to <code>include/config.php</code> and edit it.
* Ensure that the <code>templates_c</code> directory can be written to by your webserver.
* Load the schema into mysql: <code>mysql -uwww -Dflamework -p < schema/db_main.schema</code>

That's it.

##Global Variables

Flamework uses and assigns global PHP variables on the grounds that it's really just not that big a 
deal. A non-exhaustive list of global variables that Flameworks assigns is:

* `$GLOBALS['cfg']` -- A great big hash that contains all the various site configs and runtime user authentication info.

* `$GLOBALS['smarty']` -- A [Smarty](http://www.smarty.net/) templating object.

* `$GLOBALS['timings']` & `$GLOBALS['timing_keys']` -- Hashs used to store site performance metrics.

Some libraries use their own globals internally, usually prefixed with `LIBRARYNAME_` or `_LIBRARYNAME_`.

## Tests

If you have perl's <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Harness/">Test::Harness</a> installed (you almost certainly do), 
you can run the tests using:

    prove --exec 'php' tests/*.t

Test coverage is in great need of improving.
